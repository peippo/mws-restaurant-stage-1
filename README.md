# Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 1 (Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course)

Converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Stage 1 started with a static design that lacked accessibility and I converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.
